# Files and folders excluded from export artifacts (used by git archive)
# The mirror workflow uses `git archive | tar -x` to build the public tree,
# so anything marked with export-ignore here will NOT appear in the public repo.

# Exclude GitHub workflows and CI
.github export-ignore

# Exclude VCS ignore files
.gitignore export-ignore

# Add more lines as needed, e.g.:
# docs/internal/ export-ignore
# scripts/private/ export-ignore
# *.secret export-ignore
scripts/ export-ignore
